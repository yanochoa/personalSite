## About me

<p>![](./gus-and-I.PNG)</p>

<p>Im a software developer currently living in Downtown Phoenix with my girlfriend Emily and my dog Gus</p>

<p>I graduated from The University of Arizona with a BS in Computer Science plus a minor in Chemical Engineering</p>

<p>I want to be really good at what I do, so I do it a lot. That's what this website is for, I'd like to document my side projects and lessons learned along the way</p>
