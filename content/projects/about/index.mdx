## About me

<p>![](./gus-and-I.PNG)</p>

<p>Im a Software developer currently living in Downtown Phoenix with my Girfriend Emily and my dog Gus.</p>

<p>I graduated from The University of Arizona with a BS in Computer Science plus a minor in Chemical Engineering.</p>

<p>Truthfully speaking, I want to be really good at what I do. So I do it a lot. That's what this website is for. I'd like to document my side projects and lessons learned along the way</p>
